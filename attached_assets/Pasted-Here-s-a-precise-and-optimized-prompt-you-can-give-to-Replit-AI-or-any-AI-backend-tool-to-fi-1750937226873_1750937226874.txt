**Prompt for Replit AI:**

Fix and enhance the backend of the Workshop Booking Website with the following features and behaviors:

---

### 🛠️ 🔒 **Fix Registration & Authentication Flow:**

* After **sign-up**, users must be **redirected to login**, not granted instant access.
* Add proper **JWT-based session handling** so that access is only granted **after login**.

---

### 🧾 **Workshop Registration & Dashboard Sync:**

* When a user registers for a workshop:

  * A **registration entry** must be created with:

    * user\_id
    * workshop\_id
    * status: `"pending"` (manual) or `"confirmed"` (automated)
* This registered workshop must be **added to the user’s “My Workshops”** dashboard with:

  * Workshop title, date, status (pending/confirmed), and mode.
* Automatically update the **dashboard UI/data** without needing a page reload (enable polling or sockets if possible).

### 🔄 **Make All CRUD Functional:**

#### 👤 **User:**

* ✅ Create: Signup
* 📝 Read: View available workshops & registered ones
* ✏️ Update: Profile (edit name, password), update screenshot
* ❌ Delete: Delete account

#### 🏢 **Enterprise:**

* ✅ Create: New workshop
* 📝 Read: Their own workshops and registrations
* ✏️ Update: Edit their workshops
* ❌ Delete: Delete their workshops

#### 🛡️ **Admin:**

* ✅ Create: Default admin account
* 📝 Read:

  * All users
  * All enterprises
  * All workshops
  * All registrations
* ✏️ Update:

  * Approve/reject workshops
  * Approve/reject user registrations
  * Edit user or enterprise data

---

### 💡 Additional Backend Fixes:

* Include middleware to restrict access based on user role.
* Add timestamps for registrations and updates.
* Support status transitions: from “pending” → “confirmed” → “completed” (optional).
* Improve response messages to reflect actions taken (e.g., "Workshop approved", "Registration rejected").
